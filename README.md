# MultiChat_with_encryption
This is a Client server encryption project that uses AES algorithm to encrypt messages on the wire.  

 (Platform - Python): 
Implemented a secure chat application between two clients via a server. 
As the encrypted message traffic would be routed via server,
the server would note the time stamp of the message and the user. 
Only the end clients and the server can read the message(pre shared key) which was encrypted with AES Algorithm.
